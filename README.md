#Project Objective

This project aims to conduct a structured financial and business analysis of Apple Inc. using publicly available financial statements. The analysis follows the practical workflow of a financial, business, and data analyst by evaluating Apple’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement to assess profitability, financial stability, cash generation, and capital allocation decisions.

The project is designed as a hands-on analytical exercise using real company data to strengthen financial statement interpretation, analytical thinking, and data organization skills. Financial data is sourced directly from Apple Inc.’s Form 10-K filings, structured and analyzed using analytical tools, and documented in a clear, reproducible format suitable for professional and academic review.

# Expected Outcome

The objective of this project is to develop a clear, analyst-style understanding of Apple Inc.’s financial performance, business model, and long-term sustainability, while building a professional, portfolio-ready financial analysis project that demonstrates practical analytical skills relevant to academic admissions and entry-level analyst roles.
